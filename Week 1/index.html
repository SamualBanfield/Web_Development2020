    <h2>Americans seem to carry bottled water everywhere they go these days. In fact, it has become the second most
      popular drink (behind soft drinks). But water lovers got a jolt recently when we heard that a new report had found
      that the benefits of drinking water may have been oversold. Apparently, the old suggestion to drink eight glasses
      a day was nothing more than a guideline, not based on scientific evidence.</h2>
